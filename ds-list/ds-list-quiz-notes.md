## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Briefly describe the List data structure.
  A List data structure holds data in elements of the same size, and are accessed by index. They can be linked, queue (first in, first out), or a stack (last in, first ut).

- What are some examples of when you would use a List?
  You might want to use a List when you need a priority queue, when you need to serve different items based on a certain order of priority you've determined.

- How do you read an element of a List given its index? What is its time complexity?
  You can add an element into a List at a given index by using `peek`. The time complexity is O(1), or constant-time.

- How do you add an element into a List at a given index? What is its time complexity?
  You can add an element into a List at a given index by using `enqueue`. The time complexity is O(n), or linear-time.

- How do you update an element in a List at a given index? What is its time complexity?
  The time copmlexity is O(1), or constant-time.

- How do you remove an element from a List at a given index? What is its time complexity?
  You can add an element into a List at a given index by using `dequeue`. The time complexity is O(n), or linear-time.
