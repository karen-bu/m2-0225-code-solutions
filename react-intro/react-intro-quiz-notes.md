## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is React?
  React is a library of components that can help developers build websites and interfaces more quickly, as these components are pre-made and ready to use. Like buying bricks pre-made to build a house instead of making your own!

- What is a React component?
  A React component is a self-contained collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript already built to provide the functionality necessary for a certain element (like a form, a list, etc.).

- How do you mount a React app (root component) to the DOM?
  You can mount a React app to the DOM by using `Vite` to create a React application. Once the application is created, there will be an `src` folder with a `main.tsx` file that will connect the React files to the `index.html` file.

- What are some other popular frontend frameworks?
  Other popular frontend frameworks include `Angular`, `Vue` and `Svelte`.
