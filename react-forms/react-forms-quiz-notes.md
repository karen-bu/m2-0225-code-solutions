- How do controlled components differ from uncontrolled components?
  Controlled components differ from uncontrolled components as controlled components have their state managed by the component that renders it. Uncontrolled components manage their own state - such as if a DOM manages the value, instead of React or the developer.

- What are some advantages of using uncontrolled components?
  Advantages to using uncontrolled components are that you can directly modify the DOM, and you don't need to bother with state setter variables and functions.

- What are some advantages of using controlled components?
  Some advantages of using controlled components are that you do not have to access or modify the DOM in any way which is frowned upon in React, that you can store a data somewhere easily accessible, and that the code is somewhat cleaner.

- Which style do you prefer?

- What two props must you pass to an input for it to be "controlled"?

  Popular npm packages for creating forms are React Hook Form, Formik, and React Final Form.
