      This cat belongs to my neighbor, Luis. This cat's name is Chele, though
      before I learned his name, I called him Flan, because of his colors, or
      Captain Morgan, because of his attitude. Chele is definitely an orange
      cat. He yells constantly and knocks my neighbor's wall decorations over
      onto my driveway. Once, I got home late at night to find him staring at me
      from the roof of my garage. Chele has a sister named Mita, a tortie, who
      is very sweet, affectionate, and more well-behaved. They're the prettiest
      pair of cats I have ever met!
