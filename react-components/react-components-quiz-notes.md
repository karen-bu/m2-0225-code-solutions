## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a React component?
  A React component are functions that create reusable UI elements containing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript necessary to build and give functionality to a portion of the website.

- How do you define a component in React?
  I would define a React component as a package containing pre-built parts of the website assembled together. If you're building a Lego landscape for example, each part of the landscape (a house, a tree, an animal) could be a React component, but the bricks would be each element in the component.

- How is a component "rendered" (made visible on the browser page)?
  A component is "rendered" by being called in the overall `App()` function, which is then tied to the html document with the `root` div.
