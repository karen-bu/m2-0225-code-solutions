## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is JSX?
  JSX is a JavaScript extension that allows developers to write code for dynamic DOM creation. This allows complex HTML structures, CSS styles, and attributes to be applied very quickly. The syntax for JSX is very similar to HTML, but the code is a lot easier to read and more organized.

- How does React use JSX to render components?
  React uses JSX to render components as functions can return JSX markup. This can then be used to construct the DOM. In short, React will call the component function, that then converts to HTML and pushed to the DOM, which is then displayed by the browser.
