## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the 3 components of a fullstack Web architecture?
  The 3 components of fullstack Web architecture are the `frontend` that the user interacts with, the `backend` that takes and processes requests from the frontend, and the `database` where data is stored and used across all instances of the frontend.

- What is Node.js and why is it useful?
  Node.js is a program that allows JavaScript to be run outside of a web browser. It is useful because it is written in a combination of common languages, and can be used to build backend servers for Web applications.

- What are environment variables and how do you access them in Node.js?
  Environment variables hold configuration information for the specific environment the process is running in, without needed for code to be changed when a developer is in a dev vs. testing vs. production environment. You can access all environment variables in `process.env`, in the process object that Node.js makes available to files it executes.

- What is a REPL?
  A `REPL` or a `read-eval-print loop` is an environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user.
