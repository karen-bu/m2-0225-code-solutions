  The `Array` method `map` is commonly used to create a list of React components.

- Why do components in a list need to have unique keys?
  Components in a list need to have unique keys to be able to distinguish them from other components in the list.

  The best value to use as a `key` prop when rendering lists should be a unique one. If you have no other values handy, you can use the `index` value.
